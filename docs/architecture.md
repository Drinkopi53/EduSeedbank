# EduSeedbank Architecture

## Overview
EduSeedbank is a Python application that generates offline educational content packages ("seeds") that can be distributed via LoRa mesh networks to rural schools with limited or no internet connectivity.

## Core Components

1. **Content Packaging System**
   - Packages educational materials (videos, HTML content) into compressed "seed" files
   - Customizes content based on regional curriculum requirements
   - Manages metadata for each seed package

2. **LoRa Mesh Networking**
   - Implements LoRa communication protocols
   - Handles seed distribution between nodes
   - Manages network topology and routing

3. **Compression System**
   - Compresses video content for low-bandwidth transmission
   - Optimizes file sizes while maintaining educational quality
   - Supports various compression algorithms

4. **HTML Interactive Content Generator**
   - Creates interactive HTML educational materials
   - Supports quizzes, exercises, and multimedia integration
   - Generates self-contained HTML packages

5. **Local Server**
   - Serves downloaded content to school devices
   - Manages user accounts and progress tracking
   - Provides administrative interface

6. **CLI Interface**
   - Command-line interface for system administration
   - Content packaging commands
   - Network management tools

## System Workflow

1. Educators or content creators use EduSeedbank to package educational content
2. Content is customized for specific regional curricula
3. Packages are compressed and optimized for LoRa transmission
4. Seeds are distributed through LoRa mesh networks to rural schools
5. Schools download and "plant" seeds on their local servers
6. Students access educational content through the local server

## Technical Stack

- Python 3.8+ as the core language
- Flask for the local server
- SQLite for local data storage
- FFmpeg for video compression
- Custom LoRa communication protocols
